getDeprecatedComponents
************************

getDeprecatedComponents is a simple executable that reads the map sofa::helper::deprecated::components and outputs all components.
It is used by SOFA CI scripts to avoid testing scenes that contain deprecated components.
WARNING: the map needs to be up-to-date!
